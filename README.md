topology optimization modeling framwork for micromixer  

The open-source CFD software OpenFOAM is used to solve the forward problem equations, adjoint equations and other PDE equations with FVM. The micromixer structure is optimized with countious adjoint method. 

This solver is based on OpenFOAM-7 https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-7  
If you other version of OpenFOAM, maybe you should change some code.  
To clone repository
>> git clone https://github.com/na-an/TOLL.git

In the OpenFOAM, you should change the parallel initialization. 

Before you use this framwork to optimization micromixer, you should install Petsc.

This optimization model will be constantly update.
