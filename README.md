topology optimization modeling framwork for micromixer  

The open-source CFD software OpenFOAM is used to solve the forward problem equations, adjoint equations and other PDE equations with FVM. The micromixer structure is optimized with countious adjoint method. 

In the OpenFOAM, you should change the parallel initialization. 

And if you have any problems, you can contact me by email, najian@tju.edu.cn
